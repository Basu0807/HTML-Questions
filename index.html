    <h1>DAY-1 HTML Interview Questions:-</h1>
    <h2><u>1. Differencebetween div and span ?</u></h2>
    <h3>Div tag</h3>
    <p>
      The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make
      divisions of content on the web page like (text, images, header, footer,
      navigation bar, etc). Div tag has both opening div and closing tags and it
      is mandatory to close the tag. As we know Div tag is a block-level tag. In
      this example, the div tag contains the entire width. It will be displayed
      div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.
    </p>
    <h3>Span tag</h3>
    <p>
      The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements
      and content. It used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the
      class or id attributes). A better way to use it when no other semantic
      element is available. The span tag is very similar to the div tag, but div
      is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.
    </p>
    <h2><u>2. Difference between class and IDs ?</u></h2>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Class</th>
        <th>IDs</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements,</li>
            <li>
              The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform
              certain tasks for elements with the specified class name.
            </li>
            <li>The class name in CSS stylesheet using “.” symbol.</li>
          </ol>
        </td>
        <td>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The id attribute is a unique identifier that is used to specify
              the document.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is used by CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a
              unique element.
            </li>
            <li>
              In CSS, the id attribute is written using the # symbol followed by
              id.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2><u>3. What are self closing tags ?</u></h2>
    <p>
      A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be
      closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a
      separate closing tags.
    </p>
    examples:-
    <ul></ul>
      <li>img</li>
      <li>br</li>
      <li>hr</li>
      <li>input</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      <u
        >4. How many types of headings are there ?How to decide which to use
        where
      </u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      HTML defines six levels of headings, and these heading elements are H1,
      H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6. The H1 element is the highest or most important
      level, and the H6 element is the least important. These different heading
      levels help to communicate the organization and hierarchy of the content
      on a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings,
      then the less important h3 , and so on. Note: Use HTML headings for
      headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
    </p>
    <h2><u>5. Difference between block and inline ?</u></h2>
    <p>
      Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start
      from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as
      it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in
      the HTML element.
    </p>
    <h2><u>6. Difference between em and strong ?</u></h2>
    <p>
      With the "strong" tag, you can bold a part of the text. You can signify
      that the content there is "more important", while with the "em" tag you
      can put a text in italics.
    </p>
    <p>
      General consensus is that 'em' and 'strong' should be used as they
      indicate semantic meaning (i.e. 'This text or word is more important than
      the others') as well as how the text should look (i.e. 'This word should
      be bold or italic'), whereas 'b'and 'i' only do the latter.
    </p>
    <h2><u>7. What are attributes?</u></h2>
    <p>
      HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.An HTML
      attribute is a piece of markup language used to adjust the behavior or
      display of an HTML element. For example, attributes can be used to change
      the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements.
    </p>
    example:- name, value, height, width, type etc.

    <h2><u>8. Difference between HTML tags and elements ?</u></h2>
    <p>
      HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page. HTML Elements are components
      that are used in HTML Page. HTML Tags usually exist in pairs consisting of
      a starting and an ending tag. However, some tags do not have a closing
      tag.
